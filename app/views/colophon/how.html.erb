			<h3>Doing,<br /> not talking</h3>
			<p>It's not that hard to talk clever and think big; there's an oversupply of that in our 
			world. Too often big thinking doesn't lead to big doing, yet there are so many problems that need a bit of Do.
			Roll up your sleeves and fail gloriously. 
			Good for Nothing is permission to have a go, get involved, participate and try stuff.</p>

			<h3>Collaborate and experiment</h3>
			<p>These are words we all hear a lot. But true collaboration &ndash; where real diversity and openness is welcomed, where we let go of power and control, where we self-organise and allow ideas and energy to emerge more naturally and where we prototype and develop them rapidly &ndash; is hard to come by. We want more of it.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Support the true innovators</h3>
			<p>We give creative energy to the real innovators trying to make positive change happen. 
				Most of the exciting social, environmental and human innovation is happening at the grass-roots. 
				We provide creative support to those pioneers. We think that can help accelerate positive change and impact.</p>
